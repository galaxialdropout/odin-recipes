        <h2>You will need!</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>125ml soy sauce</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp water</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tsp grated fresh ginger</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp cooking oil, divided</li>
            <li>2 boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the marinade first. Stir together the soy sauce, brown sugar, water, garlic, ginger, and 1 Tbsp of the cooking oil in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Place the chicken in a shallow bowl or dish, then pour the marinade over top. Turn the chicken a couple of times to make sure it's well coated. Let the chicken marinate for 30 minutes to one day (refrigerated), turning the chicken occasionally as it marinates.</li>
            <li>When ready to cook the chicken, heat the remaining 1 Tbsp cooking oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add the chicken, discarding the remaining used marinade.</li>
            <li>Cook the chicken for about 5-7 minutes on each side or until cooked through and the liquid in the skillet has reduced to a light coating of glaze on the chicken.</li>
            <li>Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and let it rest for about 5 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
        </ol>
